[Woowahan Financial Ledger](http://bank.zoomkoding.com) is a web application that helps you manage your daily expenses. With its simple and flexible UI, you can use the app universally on both desktop and mobile devices(WIP). We provide you sophisticated design elements including dark mode and custom-designed, colorful cards for each vendor which harmonize each other perfectly.

Unlike the previous To Do projects, we considerably chose [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) to bundle the app instead of webpack to improve the productivity and scalability without hassle.

## Dev

### Setup environment variables

Copy and paste `src/server/.env.example` into the same directory and rename the copied file to `.env` then fill the variables.

```
src
└─ server
   ├─ .env
   └─ .env.example
```

### Run scripts

```zsh
npm install
npm start
```

> By running the `start` script from the root directory, both client and server side scripts run in parallel.
